### ðŸ“˜ Project: Portfolio Analysis and Volatility Prediction

This project combines **portfolio analysis** with **machine learning-based volatility prediction** to enhance investment decisions.  
Using data from major stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA), it predicts future volatility with a **Random Forest Regressor** and classifies market regimes into:

- ðŸŸ¥ **High Risk (Avoid Zone)** â€” Volatility above 75th percentile  
- ðŸŸ© **Low Risk (Invest Zone)** â€” Volatility below 75th percentile  

Performance is evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, showing balanced results with strong regime alignment.  
Visualizations include volatility vs. threshold and predicted vs. actual regimes.  
Predicted volatility is then used to guide portfolio allocation and generate actionable investment signals.
